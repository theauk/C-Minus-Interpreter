# C-Minus-Interpreter

The project includes a scanner.l and parser.y file, which act as an interpreter for parts of the C-- language. The program has been built with Lex, Yacc, and C. The outputs of the interpreter are text strings printed in the command line, which gives an overview of the symbol table and if the interpretation was successful. If the interpretation is unsuccessful, the user is informed with an error message.
